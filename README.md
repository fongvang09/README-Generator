# README-Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Task of the project

To create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input via Node.js terminal. When completed, the generated README page should have a title with a license badge, which I had to the right side of it. Whatever that is typed in for the GitHub and LinkedIn inputs will pull it back as the link. There should also be a table of contents. If clicked on one of the links then it will bring them to the corresponding topic.
